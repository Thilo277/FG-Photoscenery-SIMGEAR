   * Initialize the sound event.
   *
   * Prior to initialization of the sound event the program's property root
   * has to be defined, the sound configuration XML tree has to be loaded 
   * and a sound manager class has to be defined.
   *
   * A sound configuration file would look like this:
   * @code{xml}
   *  <fx>
   *   <event_name>
   *    <name/> Define the name of the event. For reference only.
   *    <mode/> Either:
   *              looped: play this sound looped.
   *              in-transit: play looped while the event is happening.
   *              once: play this sound once.
   *    <path/> The relative path to the audio file.
   *    <property/> Take action if this property becomes true.
   *    <condition/> Take action if this condition becomes true.
   *    <delay-sec/> Time after which the sound should be played.
   *    <volume> or <pitch> Define volume or pitch settings.
   *     <property/> Take the value of this property as a reference for the
   *                 result.
   *     <internal/> Either:
   *                   dt_start: the time elapsed since this sound is playing.
   *                   dt_stop: the time elapsed since this sound has stopped.
   *     <offset/> Add this value to the result.
   *     <factor/> Multiply the result by this factor.
   *     <min/> Make sure the value is never less than this value.
   *     <max/> Make sure the value is never larger than this value.
   *    </volume> or </pitch>

   * @param root        The root node of the programs property tree.
   * @param child       A pointer to the location of the current event as
   *                    defined in the configuration file.
   * @param sgrp        A pointer to a pre-initialized sample group class.
   * @param avionics    A pointer to the pre-initialized avionics sample group.
   * @param path        The path where the audio files remain.
