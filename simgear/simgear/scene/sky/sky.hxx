/**
 * \anchor SGSky-details
 *
 * A class to model a realistic (time/date/position) based sky.
 *
 * Introduction
 *
 * The SGSky class models a blended sky dome, a haloed sun, a textured
 * moon with phase that properly matches the date, stars and planets,
 * and cloud layers. SGSky is designed to be dropped into existing
 * plib based applications and depends heavily on plib's scene graph
 * library, ssg. The sky implements various time of day lighting
 * effects, it plays well with fog and visibility effects, and
 * implements scudded cloud fly-through effects. Additionally, you can
 * wire in the output of the SGEphemeris class to accurately position
 * all the objects in the sky.
 *
 * Building the sky 
 *

 * Once you have created an instance of SGSky you must call the
 * build() method.  Building the sky requires several textures. So,
 * you must specify the path/directory where these textures reside
 * before building the sky.  You do this first by calling the
 * texture_path() method.

 * The arguments you pass to the build() method allow you to specify
 * the horizontal and vertical radiuses of the sky dome, the size of
 * your sun sphere and moon sphere, a number of planets, and a
 * multitude of stars.  For the planets and stars you pass in an array
 * of right ascensions, declinations, and magnitudes.

 * Cloud Layers 

 * Cloud layers can be added, changed, or removed individually. To add
 * a cloud layer use the add_cloud_layer() method.  The arguments
 * allow you to specify base height above sea level, layer thickness,
 * a transition zone for entering/leaving the cloud layer, the size of
 * the cloud object, and the type of cloud texture. All distances are
 * in meters. There are additional forms of this method that allow you
 * to specify your own ssgSimpleState or texture name for drawing the
 * cloud layer.

 * Repainting the Sky 

 * As the sun circles the globe, you can call the repaint() method to
 * recolor the sky objects to simulate sunrise and sunset effects,
 * visibility, and other lighting changes.  The arguments allow you to
 * specify a base sky color (for the top of the dome), a fog color
 * (for the horizon), the sun angle with the horizon (for
 * sunrise/sunset effects), the moon angle (so we can make it more
 * yellow at the horizon), and new star and planet data so that we can
 * optionally change the magnitude of these (for day / night
 * transitions.)

 * Positioning Sky Objects 

 * As time progresses and as you move across the surface of the earth,
 * the apparent position of the objects and the various lighting
 * effects can change. the reposition() method allows you to specify
 * the positions of all the sky objects as well as your view position.
 * The arguments allow you to specify your view position in world
 * Cartesian coordinates, the zero elevation position in world
 * Cartesian coordinates (your longitude, your latitude, sea level),
 * the ``up'' vector in world Cartesian coordinates, current
 * longitude, latitude, and altitude. A ``spin'' angle can be
 * specified for orienting the sky with the sun position so sunset and
 * sunrise effects look correct. You must specify GMT side real time,
 * the sun right ascension, sun declination, and sun distance from
 * view point (to keep it inside your view volume.) You also must
 * specify moon right ascension, moon declination, and moon distance
 * from view point.

 * Rendering the Sky 

 * The sky is designed to be rendered in three stages. The first stage
 * renders the parts that form your back drop - the sky dome, the
 * stars and planets, the sun, and the moon.  These should be rendered
 * before the rest of your scene by calling the preDraw() method. The
 * second stage renders the clouds that are above the viewer. This stage 
 * is done before translucent objects in the main scene are drawn. It 
 * is seperated from the preDraw routine to enable to implement a 
 * multi passes technique and is located in the drawUpperClouds() method.
 * The third stage renders the clouds that are below the viewer an which 
 * are likely to be translucent (depending on type) and should be drawn 
 * after your scene has been rendered.  Use the drawLowerClouds() method 
 * to draw the second stage of the sky.

 * A typical application might do the following: 

 * \li thesky->preDraw( my_altitude );
 * \li thesky->drawUpperClouds();
 * \li ssgCullAndDraw ( myscene ) ;
 * \li thesky->drawLowerClouds();

 * The current altitude in meters is passed to the preDraw() method
 * so the clouds layers can be rendered correction from most distant
 * to closest.

 * Visibility Effects 

 * Visibility and fog is important for correctly rendering the
 * sky. You can inform SGSky of the current visibility by calling the
 * set_visibility() method.

 * When transitioning through clouds, it is nice to pull in the fog as
 * you get close to the cloud layer to hide the fact that the clouds
 * are drawn as a flat polygon. As you get nearer to the cloud layer
 * it is also nice to temporarily pull in the visibility to simulate
 * the effects of flying in and out of the puffy edge of the
 * cloud. These effects can all be accomplished by calling the
 * modify_vis() method.  The arguments allow you to specify your
 * current altitude (which is then compared to the altitudes of the
 * various cloud layers.) You can also specify a time factor which
 * should be the length in seconds since the last time you called
 * modify_vis(). The time_factor value allows the puffy cloud effect
 * to be calculated correctly.

 * The modify_vis() method alters the SGSky's internal idea of
 * visibility, so you should subsequently call get_visibility() to get
 * the actual modified visibility. You should then make the
 * appropriate glFog() calls to setup fog properly for your scene.

 * Accessor Methods 

 * Once an instance of SGSky has been successfully initialized, there
 * are a couple accessor methods you can use such as get_num_layers()
 * to return the number of cloud layers, get_cloud_layer(i) to return
 * cloud layer number i, get_visibility() to return the actual
 * visibility as modified by the sky/cloud model.
