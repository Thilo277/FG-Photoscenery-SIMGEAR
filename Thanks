A very special thanks is due to the following people and groups.

Note: as hard as we've tried, it is impossible to perfectly maintain
this file.  If you are aware of someone who you think should be
included here, PLEASE let me know.  Projects like this are made
possible only by the help and hard work of others.  I want to properly
credit everyone who has contributed to this project.


Raul Alonzo <amil@las.es>
  Mr. Alonzo is the author of Ssystem and provided his kind permission 
  for using the moon texture. I also used parts of his code as a template
  when adding the texture.  Ssystem Homepage can be found at:
  http://www1.las.es/~amil/ssystem


Paul Bleisch <pbleisch@acm.org>
  Paul redid the "debug" system so that it would be much more flexible,
  so it could be easily disabled for production system, and so that 
  messages for certain subsystems could be selectively enabled.
  Also contributed a first stab at a config file/command line parsing
  system.


Bernie Bright <bbright@c031.aone.net.au>
  Many C++ style, usage, and implementation improvements.  
  STL portability, tons o' stuff. :-)
  Currently trying to get a BeOS port together but life keeps getting 
  in the way!


Gene Buckle <geneb@deltasoft.com>
  Gene has done a lot of work getting FG to compile with the MSVC++
  compiler.  Also, he has pushed, proded, and bugged me endlessly to
  do my stuff right.  (I mean that in a good way, because sometimes
  when the little nudge in the right direction isn't working, I need
  a good hard shove.) :-)


John Check <j4strngs@rockfish.net>
  Cloud textures


Jean-Francois Doue
  Vector 2D, 3D, 4D and Matrix 3D and 4D inlined C++ classes.  (Based on
  Graphics Gems IV ed. Paul S. Heckbert)
  http://www.animats.com/simpleppp/ftp/public_html/topics/developers.html


Melchior Franz
  METAR parser and fetcher. "material" animation (based on Jim Wilsons's
  "emission" animation). Debugging and extension of property listener
  features. Addition of removeChildren.


Mathias Froehlich
  Reworked and cleaned up large parts of the infrastructure, of math
  files, animations and rendering in preparation of a transition to
  the OSG library. Added new handlers for shared and referenced objects.


Bruce Finney <bfinney@gte.net>
  MSVC5 compatibility.


Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler <zlib@gzip.org>
  Authors of the zlib library.  Used for on-the-fly compression and
  decompression routines.

Thomas Gellekum <tg@ihf.rwth-aachen.de>
  Changes and updates for compiling on FreeBSD


Habibie <habibie@MailandNews.com>
  RedHat package building changes for SimGear.


Bruce Jackson of NASA <e.b.jackson@larc.nasa.gov> 
  Developed the LaRCsim code under funding by NASA which we use to provide
  the flight model. Bruce has patiently answered my many, many questions.

Maik Justus
  Fixed an old bug in the SGPropertyNode class.


Richard Kaszeta <bofh@me.umn.edu>
  Contributed screen buffer to ppm screen shot routine.
  Rich has also helped in the early development of the Flight Gear "altitude 
  hold autopilot module" by teaching Curt Olson the basics of Control Theory 
  and helping him code and debug early versions. Curt's "Boss" Bob Hain
  also contributed <bob@me.umn.edu>.  Further details available at:
  http://www.menet.umn.edu/~curt/fgfs/Docs/Autopilot/AltitudeHold/AltitudeHold.html
  Rich's Homepage: http://www.menet.umn.edu/~kaszeta


Tom Knienieder <tom@knienieder.com>
  Ported Steve's Audio library first to OpenBSD and IRIX and
  after that also to Win32


David Megginson <david@megginson.com>
  SimGear property manager/registry


Tim Moore
  Ported the (chrome) "shader" animation to OSG, and helped with porting
  the "material" animation.


Curt Olson http://www.flightgear.org/~curt/
  Curt is responsible for overall project and source code management.
  He has his hands in many of the areas.


Petter Reinholdtsen <pere@games.no>
  Incorporated the Gnu automake/autoconf system (with libtool).
  This should streamline and standardize the build process for all
  Unix-like platforms.  It should have little effect on IDE type 
  environments since these don't use the Unix make system.


Paul Schlyter <pausch@saaf.se>  
  Mr. Schlyter provided Durk Talsma with all the information 
  he needed to write the astro code. Mr. S. is also willing 
  to answer astro-related questions whenever one needs to.
  http://welcome.to/pausch


Durk Talsma <d.talsma@chello.nl>
  Accurate Sun, Moon, and Planets. 
  Sun changes color based on position in sky.
  Moon has correct phase and blends well into the sky.
  Planets are correctly positioned and have proper magnitude.
  Added time zone support in the SGTime class.
  Help with time functions, gui, and other misc stuff.

Mark Vallevand <Mark.Vallevand@UNISYS.com>
  Contributed some METAR parsing code.
  Contributed some win32 screen printing routines.


Gary R. Van Sickle <tiberius@braemarinc.com>
  Contributed some initial GameGLUT support and other fixes.
  Has done some interesting preliminary work on a binary file format
  http://www.woodsoup.org/projs/ORKiD/fgfs.htm

  Has set up a 'Cygwin Tips' site that has been very helpful to many 
  people in getting a Cygwin Unix-on-Windows build environment set up
  so they can build FG effectively. 
  http://www.woodsoup.org/projs/ORKiD/cygwin.htm


Norman Vine <nhv@yahoo.com>
  Provided more than uncountable URL's to the "FlightGear Community".
  Many performance optimizations throughout the code.  
  Lots of windoze related contributions.
  Contributed wgs84 distance and course routines.
  Contributed a great circle route autopilot mode based on wgs84 routines.


Ed Williams <Ed_Williams@compuserve.com>
  Contributed magnetic variation code (impliments Nima WMM 2000)
  We've also borrowed from Ed's wonderful aviation formulary at various
  times as well.

Jean-Claude Wippler <jcw@equi4.com>
  Author of MetaKit - a portable, embeddible database with a portable
  data file format.  This software is not GPL'd but the author is kindly
  allowing us to bundle MetaKit with our code.  MetaKit has a liberal
  X/MIT-style license.  Please see the following URL for more info:

WoodSoup Project  http://www.woodsoup.org
  Provided computing resources and services so that the Flight Gear 
  project could have real home.  This includes, web services, 
  ftp services, shell accounts, email lists, dns services, etc.


Robert Allan Zeh <raz@cmg.FCNBD.COM>
  Helped me tremendously in figuring out the Cygnus win32 compiler and
  how to link with .dll's.  With out him the first runable win32
  version of FG would have been impossible.
